# Hand-Drawn Technical Diagram Prompts (Excalidraw/Dark Mode Style)

These prompts are designed to generate images that look like **hand-drawn developer diagrams** or **dark mode whiteboard sketches**, matching the style of the provided examples (SQL vs NoSQL).

**Use these with Gemini, DALL-E 3, or Midjourney.**

## Global Style Instructions

_For every prompt, ensure the generator follows this style:_

> **Style:** Technical diagram, "Excalidraw" style, digital hand-drawn look on a dark background (almost black #121212). White hand-written text. Vibrant pastel outline colors (Green, Blue, Orange, Purple). Clean, flat 2D lines. No shading, no 3D realism. Developer illustration aesthetic.

## Image 1: Hero Comparison (Shallow vs Deep)

**Filename:** `deep-agents-sketch-hero.png`

**Prompt:**

> A hand-drawn technical comparison diagram on a dark background. Left side: A simple Green box labeled "Shallow Agent" containing a basic loop arrow with text "Looping blindly". Right side: A complex Orange box labeled "Deep Agent" containing a structured tree diagram with text "Plan", "Delegate", and "Memory". A hand-drawn arrow points from left to right labeled "Evolution". Text should be monospaced or handwriting style.

## Image 2: The Four Pillars Architecture

**Filename:** `four-pillars-sketch.png`

**Prompt:**

> A central diagram showing a core node labeled "Deep Agent". Four distinct arrows point outward to four colored rectangular cards.
>
> 1. Top Card (Blue): Labeled "Planning" with a checkbox icon.
> 2. Right Card (Green): Labeled "File System" with a folder icon.
> 3. Bottom Card (Purple): Labeled "Sub-agents" with a network icon.
> 4. Left Card (Yellow): Labeled "System Prompts" with a document icon.
>    Dark background, white chalk-like outlines, simple hand-drawn aesthetic.

## Image 3: Context Engineering Flow

**Filename:** `context-engineering-sketch.png`

**Prompt:**

> A horizontal flow diagram on a dark background.
> Left side: A messy cloud of icons (files, code, brackets) labeled "Noise / All Data" in Red outlines.
> Middle: A funnel or filter shape labeled "Smart Selection" in Blue.
> Right side: A neat stack of three distinct papers labeled "Focused Context" in Green.
> Hand-drawn arrows connect them left-to-right to show the filtering process.

## Image 4: Subagent & Filesystem Structure

**Filename:** `subagent-delegation-sketch.png`

**Prompt:**

> An organizational chart style diagram.
> Top node: "Main Planner Agent" (Orange).
> Three branches pointing down to: "Researcher" (Blue), "Analyst" (Pink), "Writer" (Cyan).
> All three sub-agents have dotted lines connecting down to a shared wide box at the bottom labeled "Shared File System / Memory" (Grey).
> Dark background, white lines, simple hand-drawn circles for agents.

## Image 5: The Execution Loop

**Filename:** `workflow-comparison-sketch.png`

**Prompt:**

> A vertical flow chart sketched on a dark background.
> Step 1: "User Goal" (Circle).
> Arrow down to Step 2: "Write TODOs" (Rectangle).
> Arrow down to Step 3: "Execution Loop" (Diamond shape).
> Two paths out of Diamond: "Complex -> Delegate" and "Simple -> Do It".
> Both paths merge back to: "Update Files".
> Hand-drawn style, like a logic flow diagram for code.

## Image 6: Cost/Quality Trade-off

**Filename:** `cost-quality-sketch.png`

**Prompt:**

> Two simple bar charts side-by-side on a dark background.
> Left Chart labeled "Cost per Task": "Legacy Agent" is a tiny green bar, "Deep Agent" is a tall orange bar.
> Right Chart labeled "Success Rate": "Legacy Agent" is a short red bar (fail), "Deep Agent" is a very tall green bar (success).
> Hand-drawn axes and bars. Annotation text at bottom: "Higher Cost for Higher Reliability".

## Alternatives (Tools)

If AI generation is inconsistent with text, you can use these actual diagramming tools to create this look manually in minutes:

1.  **Excalidraw.com** (This is exactly the style you want - "Sloppy" style, Dark Mode).
2.  **tldraw.com**
3.  **Napkin.ai** (Great for generated diagrams).
