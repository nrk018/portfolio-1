## Image 1: Hero Image (The Evolution)

**Concept:** Contrast between a basic tool and an advanced intelligence.
**Filename:** `deep-agents-realistic-hero.png`

**Prompt:**

> Split screen comparison. Left side: A simple, vintage tin robot toy standing alone on a cold gray concrete floor, soft flat lighting. Right side: A close-up of a highly advanced, hyper-realistic artificial intelligence interface, a glowing ethereal node connecting to complex digital neural networks, deep blue and vibrant orange neon lighting, depth of field, futuristic cyber atmosphere, 8k resolution, cinematic composition.

## Image 2: The Four Pillars (Architectural Metaphor)

**Concept:** The four structural components represented as a grand futuristic structure.
**Filename:** `four-pillars-realistic.png`

**Prompt:**

> A majestic sci-fi atrium featuring four towering, translucent glass monoliths arranged in a circle. Each pillar glows with a distinct inner light (Electric Blue, Emerald Green, Royal Purple, Sunset Orange). In the center floats a complex, radiant sphere of pure energy, casting reflections on a polished obsidian floor. Photorealistic architectural render, volumetric fog, dramatic lighting, futuristic temple of knowledge, Unreal Engine 5 render style.

## Image 3: Context Engineering (The Prism Filter)

**Concept:** Filtering chaos into clarity using a lens metaphor.
**Filename:** `context-engineering-realistic.png`

**Prompt:**

> Cinematic macro shot of a high-tech optical data prism. On the left, a chaotic storm of digital debris, flying papers, and binary code noise is being sucked into the glass prism. Inside the prism, light refracts and aligns. On the right, a single, perfect, intensely bright laser beam of pure information emerges. Sharp focus on the prism, bokeh background, ray tracing, particles, high contrast, symbolising clarity from chaos.

## Image 4: Deep Agent Workflow (The Command Center)

**Concept:** Visualizing the complexity and planning capability as a control room.
**Filename:** `deep-workflow-realistic.png`

**Prompt:**

> A wide-angle interior shot of a massive, state-of-the-art futuristic mission control center. In the foreground, a sleek glass desk with a holographic "TODO" list projecting into the air. In the background, server racks stretch infinitely, and huge screens display data analytics and code streams. Cyberpunk aesthetic, moody dark blue and purple lighting, highly detailed tech environment, cinematic atmosphere, representing planning and execution.

## Image 5: Subagents (The Drone Swarm)

**Concept:** Delegation to specialized assistants.
**Filename:** `subagents-realistic.png`

**Prompt:**

> A central, glowing artificial intelligence core hovering in a dark, misty void. Orbiting closely around it are three distinct, specialized high-tech drone spheres. One drone projects a hologram of a magnifying glass (research), another projects a digital pen (writing), and the third projects a data chart. Realistic metallic textures, brushed steel, lens flare, motion blur, 8k technological masterpiece.

## Image 6: Cost vs Quality (The Artisan)

**Concept:** The trade-off between a quick cheap sketch and a masterpiece.
**Filename:** `cost-quality-realistic.png`

**Prompt:**

> A top-down photorealistic workspace shot comparing two objects. On the left, a crumpled yellow sticky note with a scribbled stick figure, harsh office lighting. On the right, a luxurious leather-bound journal with intricate, glowing golden geometric diagrams drawn with a fountain pen, warm cinematic library lighting. Extreme texture detail on the paper and leather, conveying the value of deep thought over cheap speed.

## Tips for All Platforms:

1.  **Style:** If the images look too cartoonish, add keywords like "photorealistic", "octane render", "8k", "cinematic lighting".
2.  **Lighting:** Lighting makes the difference. Use "volumetric lighting", "rim lighting", or "moody lighting" for professional results.

### Platform-Specific Parameters:

- **Midjourney:** Append `--aspect 16:9` at the end of the prompt for banner images.
- **Gemini / Imagen 3:** Specify "Wide 16:9 aspect ratio" within the text description of the prompt.
